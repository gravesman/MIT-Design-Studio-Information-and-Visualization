        This clock is like an ariel view of a beach. The blue wave would go down and up the screen like a wave going back and forth on the sand. It would take several seconds for this to happen. The wave thus slightly covers and uncovers the time, so that you have to look for a few seconds to actually see the current time.

        This clock is unique. The second hand changes the face as well as the hour and minutes hand as it sweeps around. The whole face is either a gradient color or black, and has the seconds hand sweeps it changes the face color from black to color or vice versa. As the seconds hand passes the hour and minutes hands, it changes those to either color gradient or black so that the hour and minutes hands are opposite to that of the face. Thus the face is constantly going from black to color and back and the hands doing the opposite. The color gradient could be the same everytime, change, or be rainbow.

        This clock is designed to be like a classic flip calender. The white text in the red bar, which is usually the month, is in fact the hour of the day spelled out. The black number in the middle of the frame is the minutes rather than the day. This is interesting becuase rather than seeing a date like you would expect you see the time instead.
