            <p> *This update made the icons and temperatures smaller as was suggested in class. I also tried to align things through their center and added more of a margin on the sides.<br><br>
                This first weather app shows the weather for the day, as well as the high and low temperature for the day. Then going down the gradient, wether and temperature, is shown for the current hour as well as future hours to come. As the time to that future weather gets greater and greater, the colored box it is in gets darker.</p>

        <p> *This update focused on getting the d3 graphing method to work. This was the main focus of this update and what I strived to do.I also added more clarifictaion for what the top half shows.<br><br>
            This second weather app shows the city and weather for the day as well as a graph to show the temperature at a given time and for the next 12 hours. This graph allows you to see the trend in the weather and temperature in the 12 hours to come, so that you are prepared for the day.</p>
